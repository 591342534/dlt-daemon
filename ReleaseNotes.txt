DLT - Automotive Diagnostic Log and Trace

Version: 3.0.0


Introduction
------------

The DLT daemon is the central component in GENIVI, which gathers all logs and traces from the DLT user applications. The logs and traces are stored optionally directly in a file in the ECU. The DLT daemon forwards all logs and traces to a connected DLT client.
The DLT client can send control messages to the daemon, e.g. to set individual log levels of applications and contexts or get the list of applications and contexts registered in the DLT daemon.

Known issues in this release
----------------------------

 * DLT library: Usage of dlt_user_log_write_float64() and DLT_FLOAT64() leads 
                to "Illegal instruction (core dumped)" on ARM target.
 * DLT library: Nested calls to DLT_LOG_ ... are not supported, and will lead to a deadlock.
