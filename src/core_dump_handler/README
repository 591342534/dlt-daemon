To build use cmake with -DWITH_DLT_COREDUMPHANDLER=ON


Temporary replacement of default crash handler:
If you don't want to make the change persistent just become root (not sudo) and execute the following ("man core" for details):
echo "|/usr/local/bin/dlt-cdh %t %p %s %e" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern


Persistent replacement of default crash handler:
We have to install "50-coredump.conf" to "/usr/lib/sysctl.d/" which is done automatically by "make install".
Unfortunately we also have to remove abrt with "yum remove abrtd*" because this ruthlessly overwrites our change at
every boot. This must be done when installing this stuff as Debian package.
To enable the core dump handler without rebooting we have to execute "sysctl -p /usr/lib/sysctl.d/50-coredump.conf"
